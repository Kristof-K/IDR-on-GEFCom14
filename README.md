# IDR-on-GEFCom14
Examine the performance of Isotonic Distributional Regressopn (IDR) (implemented in AlexanderHenzi/isodistrreg) in GEFCom14 forecasting competition

Isontonic Distributional Regression (IDR) is a nonparametric forecasting technique using isotonicity in the covariate response variable relation in
order to predict the conditional distribution of the response variable.

The Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom14) was an international forecasting competition demanding from its participants to predict
the {1,2,3,...,99}% quantiles of energy load and price and solar and wind power production in specific scenarios.
